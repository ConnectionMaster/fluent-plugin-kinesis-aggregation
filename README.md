# Fluent Plugin for Amazon Kinesis producing KPL records

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atlassian/fluent-plugin-kinesis-aggregation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atlassian/fluent-plugin-kinesis-aggregation)

## Before you start...

This is a rewrite of [aws-fluent-plugin-kinesis](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-fluent-plugin-kinesis) to implement
a different shipment method using the
[KPL aggregation format](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-producer/blob/master/aggregation-format.md).

*Since this plugin was forked, aws-fluent-plugin-kinesis has undergone considerable development (and improvement).
Most notably, the upcoming 2.0 release supports KPL aggregated records using google-protobuf without
the overhead of using the KPL:
https://github.com/awslabs/aws-fluent-plugin-kinesis/issues/107*

*However, it still uses msgpack for internal buffering and only uses protobuf when it ships the records,
whereas this plugin processes each record as it comes in and ships the result by simple concatenation
of the encoded records. This may not be faster, of course - could depend on the overhead of calling
the protobuf methods - but most probably is. The discussion below is also still mostly valid,
in that the awslabs plugin does not have PutRecord == chunk equivalency, but instead has its
own internal retry method.*

The basic idea is to have one PutRecord === one chunk. This has a number of advantages:

- much less complexity in plugin (less CPU/memory)
- by aggregating, we increase the throughput and decrease the cost
- since a single chunk either succeeds or fails,
  we get to use fluentd's more complex/complete retry mechanism
  (which is also exposed by the monitor plugin; we view this in datadog). The existing retry mechanism
  had [unfortunate issues under heavy load](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-fluent-plugin-kinesis/issues/42)
- we get ordering within a chunk without having to rely on sequence
  numbers (though not overall ordering)

However, there are drawbacks:

- if you're using this as an aggregator, you will need to tune the
  buffer size on your sources fairly low such that it is less
  than the low buffer_chunk_limit on the aggregator
- you have to use a KCL library to ingest
- you can't use a calculated partition key (based on the record);
  essentially, you need to use a random partition key

## Overview

[Fluentd](http://fluentd.org/) output plugin
that sends events to [Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/).

## Installation

This plugin is available as the `fluent-plugin-kinesis-aggregation` gem from RubyGems:

    gem install fluent-plugin-kinesis-aggregation

Or, if using td-agent:

    fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-kinesis-aggregation

To install from the source:

    git clone https://github.com/atlassian/fluent-plugin-kinesis-aggregation.git
    cd fluent-plugin-kinesis-aggregation
    bundle install
    rake build
    rake install

Or, if using td-agent, replace rake install with:

    fluent-gem install pkg/fluent-plugin-kinesis-aggregation

Alternatively, you can replace both the rake steps, and directly
specify the library path via RUBYLIB:

    export RUBYLIB=$RUBYLIB:/path/to/fluent-plugin-kinesis-aggregation/lib

## Dependencies

 * Ruby 2.1+
 * Fluentd 0.10.43+

## Basic Usage

Here are general procedures for using this plugin:

 1. Install.
 1. Edit configuration
 1. Run Fluentd or td-agent

You can run this plugin with Fluentd as follows:

 1. Install.
 1. Edit configuration file and save it as 'fluentd.conf'.
 1. Then, run `fluentd -c /path/to/fluentd.conf`

To run with td-agent, it would be as follows:

 1. Install.
 1. Edit configuration file provided by td-agent.
 1. Then, run or restart td-agent.

## Configuration

Here are items for Fluentd configuration file.

To put records into Amazon Kinesis,
you need to provide AWS security credentials.
If you provide aws_key_id and aws_sec_key in configuration file as below,
we use it. You can also provide credentials via environment variables as
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.  Also we support IAM Role for
authentication. Please find the [AWS SDK for Ruby Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSdkDocsRuby/latest/DeveloperGuide/ruby-dg-setup.html)
for more information about authentication.
We support all options which AWS SDK for Ruby supports.

### type

Use the word 'kinesis-aggregation'.

### stream_name

Name of the stream to put data.

### aws_key_id

AWS access key id.

### aws_sec_key

AWS secret key.

### role_arn

IAM Role to be assumed with [AssumeRole](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html).
Use this option for cross account access.

### external_id

A unique identifier that is used by third parties when
[assuming roles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) in their customers' accounts.
Use this option with `role_arn` for third party cross account access.
For details, please see [How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your AWS Resources to a Third Party](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).

### region

AWS region of your stream.
It should be in form like "us-east-1", "us-west-2".
Refer to [Regions and Endpoints in AWS General Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ak_region)
for supported regions.

### http_proxy

Proxy server, if any.
It should be in form like "http://squid:3128/"

### fixed_partition_key

Instead of using a random partition key, used a fixed one. This
forces all writes to a specific shard, and if you're using
a single thread/process will probably keep event ordering
(not recommended - watch out for hot shards!).

### num_threads

Integer. The number of threads to flush the buffer. This plugin is based on
Fluentd::Plugin::Output, so we buffer incoming records before emitting them to
Amazon Kinesis. You can find the detail about buffering mechanism [here](http://docs.fluentd.org/articles/buffer-plugin-overview).
Emitting records to Amazon Kinesis via network causes I/O Wait, so parallelizing
emitting with threads will improve throughput.

This option can be used to parallelize writes into the output(s)
designated by the output plugin. The default is 1.
Also you can use this option with *multi workers*.

### multi workers

This feature is introduced in Fluentd v0.14.
Instead of using *detach_process*, this feature can use as the following system directive.
Note that *detach_process* parameter is removed after using v0.14 Output Plugin API.
The default is 1.

    <system>
      workers 5
    </system>

### debug

Boolean. Enable if you need to debug Amazon Kinesis API call. Default is false.

## Configuration examples

Here are some configuration examles.
Assume that the JSON object below is coming to with tag 'your_tag'.

    {
      "name":"foo",
      "action":"bar"
    }

### Simply putting events to Amazon Kinesis with a partition key

In this example, a value 'foo' will be used as the partition key,
then events will be sent to the stream specified in 'stream_name'.

    <match your_tag>
    type kinesis-aggregation

    stream_name YOUR_STREAM_NAME

    aws_key_id YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY
    aws_sec_key YOUR_SECRET_KEY

    region us-east-1

    fixed_partition_key foo

    # You should set the buffer_chunk_limit to substantially less
    # than the kinesis 1mb record limit, since we ship a chunk at once.
    buffer_chunk_limit 300k
    </match>

### Improving throughput to Amazon Kinesis

The achievable throughput to Amazon Kinesis is limited to single-threaded
PutRecord calls, which should be at most around 300kb each.
The plugin can also be configured to execute in parallel.
The **detach_process** and **num_threads** configuration settings control
parallelism.

In case of the configuration below, you will spawn 2 processes.

    <match your_tag>
    type kinesis

    stream_name YOUR_STREAM_NAME
    region us-east-1

    detach_process 2
    buffer_chunk_limit 300k
    </match>

You can also specify a number of threads to put.
The number of threads is bound to each individual processes.
So in this case, you will spawn 1 process which has 50 threads.

    <match your_tag>
    type kinesis

    stream_name YOUR_STREAM_NAME
    region us-east-1

    num_threads 50
    buffer_chunk_limit 300k
    </match>

Both options can be used together, in the configuration below,
you will spawn 2 processes and 50 threads per each processes.

    <match your_tag>
    type kinesis

    stream_name YOUR_STREAM_NAME
    region us-east-1

    detach_process 2
    num_threads 50
    buffer_chunk_limit 300k
    </match>
